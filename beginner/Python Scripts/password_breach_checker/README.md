# Compromised Password Checker using Have I Been Pwned API

This Python script checks whether a password has been compromised in known data breaches by querying the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords) API.

It uses the k-Anonymity model to ensure your password is never sent in plain text.

---

## üîê How It Works

1. The password is hashed using SHA-1.
2. Only the **first 5 characters** of the hash are sent to the Have I Been Pwned API.
3. The API responds with all matching suffixes.
4. The script checks if your hash suffix is among them.

This preserves your privacy while still checking against a massive database of breached passwords.
