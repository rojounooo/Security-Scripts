# üîç Simple Python Port Scanner using Nmap

This Python script scans a target host for open ports using the `nmap` library.

It utilizes the `nmap` tool installed on your system to perform a comprehensive scan across all 65535 TCP ports.

---

## üõ† How It Works

1. Takes a single command-line argument: the target IP address or hostname.
2. Uses Python's `nmap` module to invoke the `nmap` command.
3. Scans all ports (`1-65535`) on the specified host.
4. Prints out open ports and their states for each protocol.

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [`python-nmap`](https://pypi.org/project/python-nmap/) module
- `nmap` must be installed on your system

Install the required Python module using:

```bash
pip install python-nmap
```

Ensure `nmap` is installed on your system:

- On Debian/Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install nmap
  ```

- On macOS (with Homebrew):
  ```bash
  brew install nmap
  ```

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the script with a target IP or hostname:

```bash
python3 port_scanner.py <host>
```

Example:

```bash
python3 port_scanner.py 192.168.1.1
```

## üìä Output Example

```
Scanning host: 192.168.1.1
Protocol: tcp
Port: 22	State: open
Port: 80	State: open
Port: 443	State: closed
```
