# Password Strength Checker

This Python script evaluates the strength of a password based on a defined policy. It checks for minimum length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The script outputs a summary of the password‚Äôs compliance with each rule and assigns an overall strength rating.
